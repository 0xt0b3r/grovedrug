So i am back with another Ymap for you guys.

This is a very simple drug set up in grove street. I felt it is abit empty BUT did NOT want to go over the top here.

I have added a gun part and a drug parts and alot a weed grow as well, It is upto you how you use it in your server and how your players use it, You or your devs could have some run around this.
